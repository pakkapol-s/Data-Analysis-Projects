Challenge 


Your last challenge is to write a query that returns a statistical report of vaccinations.
The report should include the total number of vaccinations for several dimensions:
🢂 Annual
🢂 Per species
🢂 For each species per year
🢂 By each staff member
🢂 By each staff member per species
And to make it interesting, let’s throw in the latest vaccination year for each of these groups.
